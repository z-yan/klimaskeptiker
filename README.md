# The Language of Climate Change Skeptics
This project contains tools used for analyzing the language of *climate skeptics* used in Betani Slavova's Master thesis. These are:
* a tool to scrape posts from the climate skeptic blog [Kalte Sonne](https://kaltesonne.de/).
* a tool to scrape publications by climate skeptic lobby [EIKE e.V.](https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/)
* a tool to produce word clouds based on keywords and their *keyness* score.
* a tool to (non-exhaustively) remove English-language passages from German text.

The repository also contains some scraped data used in further analysis.
